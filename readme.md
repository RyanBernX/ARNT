 # ARNT beta 1.0
 A MATLAB software for solving optimization problems on manifold.

 # Problems and solvers
 - The package contains codes for optimization problems on manifold:   
    ​        min  f(x)  s.t. x in M,
    where M is Riemannian manifold.

 - The manifold structure of ARNT is taken from the Manopt package. Further information can be found on the website www.manopt.org. We thank the authors for kindly sharing their codes. Their specific licenses should be considered before modifying and/or redistributing them.
